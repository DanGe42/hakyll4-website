title: An introduction to Git
---
I created an introduction to Git presentation to help students in the operating
systems course for which I am a teaching assistant at my university.
[Check it out](http://git-present.dge.io/).

Feel free to check out my [Github
repository](https://github.com/DanGe42/git-presentation) for these slides. I
highly appreciate any feedback. If you can, file an issue or make a pull request
on my repo; otherwise, you can just send me an email or a
[tweet](http://twitter.com/kibib1te).

While Git comes as second-nature to some of us, there are many of us who either
have managed to evade version control or find Git to be confusing. My goal for
this presentation was to start students off the right way in a span of about one
hour by going through the basic workflow (status -&gt; add -&gt; status -&gt;
commit -&gt; ... -&gt; push), some very useful tips (e.g. resolving merge
conflicts, avoiding bad practices like `git commit -am`), and leaving off with
some links to additional readings and topics.

## Attribution

Feel free to re-use my slides for your own purposes. All I humbly ask is that if
