# About me

I am a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I
am a member of the [Science and Technology Wing](http://www.stwing.org/), and I
live in [Kings Court English College House](http://kcech.house.upenn.edu/).

My technical interests involve web and mobile. I particularly enjoy civic
hacking. My nontechnical interests involve taking pictures, especially those
involving celestial objects.

### Resume

Will be coming to a personal website near you.
