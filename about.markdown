# About me

I am a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I
am a member of the [Science and Technology Wing](http://www.stwing.org/), and I
live in [Kings Court English College House](http://kcech.house.upenn.edu/).

My technical interests involve web and mobile. I particularly enjoy civic
hacking. My nontechnical interests involve taking pictures, especially those
involving celestial objects.

### Projects

This is a selection of projects (in some meaningful order) that you can find on
my [Github account](https://github.com/DanGe42).

* [ISS Base Station](http://spaceappschallenge.org/project/iss-base-station) -
  Three-pronged (hardware, mobile, web) project for tracking the International
  Space Station. First place at Space Apps Philadelphia, and still in
  development.
* [Doortags](https://github.com/Doortags) - A mobile application that reads NFC
  tags as doorbells and sends notifications to the tags' owners. Slowly being
  developed.
* [Snippit](https://github.com/DanGe42/snippets) - A Rails webapp that allows
  users to post short, awesome code snippets.
