  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>I am a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania.
  I am a proud <a href="http://www.stwing.org/">STWinger</a> and I hail from
  the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

  <p>I am interested in the ways of web and mobile development. I like building
  things, particularly web apps, though I do not intend to limit myself to
  those. Check out what I have worked on at my
  <a href="/projects/">projects</a> page.

  <h2>Employment</h2>
  <p>I worked as a Ruby on Rails engineer at
  <a href="http://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a> over the summer as an intern
  on the product team. I focused on internal tools: I
  released my own <a
    href="https://github.com/PagerDuty/state-history-validator">RubyGem</a> and
  worked on delivering reports on billing metrics.

  <p>At UPenn, I am currently employed as a Information Technology Advisor
  Manager at <a href="http://kcech.house.upenn.edu/">Kings Court English College
    House</a>, a college house at Penn. My primary responsibility is to provide
  computing support for KCECH. But sometimes, I go just a little <a
    href="http://kcech-hunt.danielge.org/">beyond that</a>.
